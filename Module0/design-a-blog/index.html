                        <p>Today I haven't spent as much time as I should've practicing Module 0, but I am hopefully making up for it before I go to bed, the goal is to finish designing this blog project, and make it somewhat appealing (although, I have terrible design qualities) but, hopefully it flows together without a lot of troubles. So far it is great fun, I've even played around a little with an Apache server just for giggles. I bought this MacBook for class, but it makes it so easy to SSH into my raspberry pi microcomputers, and have them run little meaningless tasks. TLDR: The apache server is running, and hosts a website for my local network, but it doesn't host to the internet... yet, it does, but you have to use my public IP address, and I don't really want to do that...</p>

                        <p>Well, I've officially begun. I was assigned Module 0 by Bob, and so far most of it is review as far as the syntax and commands go. The projects, however, are definitely challenging, and are put together in a way that makes me think about how to tie everything I've known and learned before together, I'm also practing how to google things that I am unfamiliar with. Over all the learning experience has been great, and in practice, it fits perfectly into my day to day routine with work - I have plenty of time to just spend watching the lectures and practicing what they teach through the day.</p>

                        <p>Today I started at the VSchool. It's a coding school based out of Salt Lake - I had never heard of them up until a couple of weeks ago when I decided to dive into this adventure. This is possibly the best decision I've ever made, next to marrying my wife, who is the one that told me to grow a set and just do it. She's definitely inspirational in her own way, and I love her to death. The VSchool so far is wonderful, the staff is great to work with, and I'm really enjoying that I can go at my own pace, It's a great way to fill the time at work when I don't have anything to do. And in hopefully set myself up for some great things in the future.
